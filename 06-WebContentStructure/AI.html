    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
    <h2>AI Definition</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
        of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
        requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
        problem-solving, understanding natural language,
        recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>
    <p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
        and techniques, such as machine learning, natural
        language processing, robotics, and computer vision.

        <li>In relation to artificial intelligence,
            the following key concepts can be distinguished:</li>
        <li>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
            that allows systems to learn from data and improve
            over time without being explicitly programmed.
            Examples include recommendation systems (like
            Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.</li>
